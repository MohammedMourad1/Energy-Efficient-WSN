# Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) Simulation Using LEACH Protocol
This repository contains MATLAB code that implements a comprehensive simulation of a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) based on the LEACH (Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy) protocol.

LEACH is a well-known hierarchical clustering protocol specifically designed to enhance the energy efficiency of sensor nodes in a WSN. By organizing nodes into dynamic clusters with rotating cluster heads, LEACH significantly reduces energy consumption, thus prolonging the overall network lifetime.

# Key Features:
Hierarchical Clustering: Nodes are grouped into clusters, each managed by a cluster head responsible for aggregating and forwarding data.

Energy Efficiency: The protocol reduces redundant data transmissions and balances energy usage by rotating cluster heads periodically.

Network Lifetime Extension: By minimizing energy consumption, LEACH maximizes the operational duration of the sensor network.

Scalability: Suitable for large-scale deployments of sensor nodes with minimal overhead.

Simulation Parameters: Configurable number of nodes, initial energy, data packet size, and rounds of operation.

# Purpose:
The simulation helps researchers and engineers study the behavior and performance of the LEACH protocol in different network settings, enabling optimization and development of more efficient WSN applications.

# How to Use:
1) Configure simulation parameters in the MATLAB script.

2) Run the simulation to observe energy consumption, cluster formation, and network lifetime.

3) Analyze the results to evaluate the efficiency of the LEACH protocol.
